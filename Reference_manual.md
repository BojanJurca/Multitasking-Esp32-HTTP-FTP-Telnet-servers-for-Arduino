## startWiFi () function

startWiFi reads WiFi configuration parameters from files: /network/interfaces, /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf, /etc/dhcpcd.conf and /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf and starts WiFi accordingly. These files are pretty much the same as it is normal in Linux and can be edited by vi telnet command. If the file system is not mounted then it just take network configuration parameters from #definitions: DEFAULT_STA_SSID, DEFAULT_STA_PASSWORD, DEFAULT_AP_SSID (#define it as "" if you don't want AP), DEFAULT_AP_PASSWORD (at least 8 charCTERS), HOSTNAME, DEFAULT_STA_IP, DEFAULT_STA_SUBNET_MASK, DEFAULT_STA_GATEWAY, DEFAULT_STA_DNS_1, DEFAULT_STA_DNS_2, DEFAULT_AP_IP, DEFAULT_AP_SUBNET_MASK. When being called the first time after the file system is formatted it creates configuration files with default #definitions.

## TcpServer class threaded constructor

TcpServer class has two constructors: threaded and non-threaded. The TcpServer constructor creates a new thread/task/process for the listener and a new thread/task/process for each TcpConnection it creates when new TCP connections are requested by connecting clients. Non-threaded constructor creates a new thread/task/process only for the listener and accepts only one TCP connection. The handling of TcpConnection is left to the calling program. The only use of the latter I found is for handling passive data FTP connections.

# Programmer's reference manual for time_functions.h


## Compile time definitions

Before #include-ing "time_functions.h" the following definitions can be #defined:

```C++
#define TIMEZONE   CET_TIMEZONE   // this is the default definition
```

  - TIMEZONE tells ESP32 server how it should calculate local time from GMT. You can change the default setting to one of already supported time zones: KAL_TIMEZONE, MSK_TIMEZONE, SAM_TIMEZONE, YEK_TIMEZONE, OMS_TIMEZONE, KRA_TIMEZONE, IRK_TIMEZONE, YAK_TIMEZONE, VLA_TIMEZONE, SRE_TIMEZONE, PET_TIMEZONE, JAPAN_TIMEZONE, CHINA_TIMEZONE, WET_TIMEZONE, ICELAND_TIMEZONE, CET_TIMEZONE, EET_TIMEZONE, FET_TIMEZONE, NEWFOUNDLAND_TIMEZONE, ATLANTIC_TIME_ZONE, ATLANTIC_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, EASTERN_TIMEZONE, EASTERN_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, CENTRAL_TIMEZONE, CENTRAL_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, MOUNTAIN_TIMEZONE, MOUNTAIN_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, PACIFIC_TIMEZONE, ATLANTIC_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, EASTERN_TIMEZONE, CENTRAL_TIMEZONE, MOUNTAIN_TIMEZONE, PACIFIC_TIMEZONE, ALASKA_TIMEZNE, HAWAII_ALEUTIAN_TIMEZONE, HAWAII_ALEUTIAN_NO_DST_TIMEZONE, AMERICAN_SAMOA_TIMEZONE, BAKER_HOWLAND_ISLANDS_TIMEZONE, WAKE_ISLAND_TIMEZONE, CHAMORRO_TIMEZONE.

```C++
#define DEFAULT_NTP_SERVER_1   "1.si.pool.ntp.org"   // this is the default definition 
#define DEFAULT_NTP_SERVER_2   "2.si.pool.ntp.org"   // this is the default definition
#define DEFAULT_NTP_SERVER_3   "3.si.pool.ntp.org"   // this is the default definition
```

  - NTP_SERVER definitions tell ESP32 server where to get current time (GMT) from, when certain functions are being called (see startCronDaemon). You can change the default settings to NTP servers close to you. These #definitions will be written to /etc/ntp.conf file which ESP32 reads each time it starts up. 


## void setGmt (time_t);


**Description**

## String ntpDate (String);   


**Description**

ntpDate synchronizes ESP32 built-in clock with NTP server. ESP32 must have an internet connection before ntpDate is called. This function is also called internally by ntpdate telnet command.


**Declaration**

```C++
String ntpDate (String ntpServer);
```


**Parameter**

  - String ntpServer is the name of NTP server by which ESP32 built-in clock is to be synchronized.


**Return value**

  - "" if synchronization succeeded
  - error message if not


## String ntpDate ();


**Description**

ntpDate synchronizes ESP32 built-in clock with one of NTP servers specified in /etc/ntp.conf configuration file. ESP32 must have an internet connection before ntpDate is called. File system must be mounted and /etc/ntp.conf configured. If this is not the case, then ntpDate will try the default NTP_SERVER #definitions. This function is also called internally by ntpdate telnet command and cronDaemon.


**Declaration**

```C++
String ntpDate ();
```


**Return value**

  -  if synchronization succeeded
  - error message if not


## startCronDaemon (void (* cronHandler) (String&), size_t);


**Description**

startCronDaemon starts special task or process called cronDaemon that:

  - Updates internal ESP32 clock with NTP server(s) once a day.

  - constantly checks the content of cron table inside ESP32 server memory and calls cornHandler function when the time is right. cronDaemon will read its configuration from /etc/ntp.conf and /etc/crontab files when ESP32 starts up. If the files do not exist yet it will create new ones from compile time #definitions with default values.


**Declaration**

```C++
void startCronDaemon (void (* cronHandler) (String&), size_t cronStack = (3 * 1024));
```


**Parameters**

  - void (* cronHandler) (String&) is a callback function that cronDaemon will call as defined by cron table. Cron table resides in ESP32 memory and is filled with the content of /etc/crontab file each time ESP32 starts up. Beside this it can also be managed through cronTabAdd and cronTabDel functions. If you are not going to use a cron table then this parameter can be NULL.

  - size_t cronStack is stack size cronDaemon will be using. cronDaemon runs as separate thread/task/process so it needs its own stack. 3 KB is only enough for daily time synchronizations with NTP servers. If you are going to use cronHandler you better increase it to 8 KB. If your cronHandler is stack-hungry you may have to add more stack.


## bool cronTabAdd (uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t, String, bool);


**Description**

cronTabAdd adds a new cron command definition into cron table.


**Declaration**

```C++
bool cronTabAdd (uint8_t second, uint8_t minute, uint8_t hour, uint8_t day, uint8_t month, uint8_t day_of_week, String cronCommand, bool readFromFile = false); 
```


**Parameters**

  - uint8_t second defines the second (local time) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - uint8_t minute defines the minute (local time) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - uint8_t hour defines the hour (local time) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - uint8_t day defines the day of month (local time) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - uint8_t month defines the month of year (local time) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - uint8_t day_of_week defines the day of week (local time, Sunday = 1, ) when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to ANY.

  - String cronCommand is the croncommand that is going to be passed to cronHandler.

  - bool readFromFile = false is used internally, normally it should be left false.


**Return value**

  - true if succeeded

  - false if there is no more space in cron table. Cron table can include up to 32 entries, including those that are uploaded from /etc/crontab file during ESP32 start up.


## bool cronTabAdd (String, bool);


**Description**

cronTabAdd adds a new cron command definition into cron table.


**Declaration**

```C++
bool cronTabAdd (String cronTabLine, bool readFromFile = false); 
```

**Parameters**

  - String cronTabLine contains definition cron command and when it should be called in text format. This is the same format as in /etc/crontab file: 6 numbers and cron command text. The numbers correspond to second, minute, hour, day of month, month of year, day of week when cronHandler will be called with cronCommand parameter. If it is not important set it to *.

  - bool readFromFile = false is used internally, normally it should be left false.


**Return value**

  - true if succeeded

  - false if there is no more space in cron table. Cron table can include up to 32 entries, including those that are uploaded from /etc/crontab file during ESP32 start up.


## int cronTabDel (String);


**Description**

cronTabDel deletes cron command definition from cron table.


**Declaration**

```C++
int cronTabDel (String cronCommand);
```


**Parameters**

  - String cronCommand contains the nme of the command to be deleted from cron table.


**Return value**

The number of deleted cron tab entries. This number can be 0 (if cronCommand did not exist in cron table), 1 (if it did) and even > 1 since there may be more than 1 entry for the same cronCommand in cron table.

  - error message if failed


***Note***

Unlike any other configuration file Esp32_web_ftp_telnet_server_template is using, /etc/mail/sendmail.cf is not generated by the template with default values. You have to create it manually yurself if you want to use it.
